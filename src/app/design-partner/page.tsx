              Coding agents are getting genuinely good at writing code. But
              when something breaks at runtime — a flaky test, a race
              condition, a bug that only happens in production — they&apos;re
              flying blind. No DOM state. No network timing. No component
              tree. Just your codebase and a guess.
            </p>
            <p>
              Replay MCP closes that gap. It gives your agent the browser
              runtime context it needs to diagnose bugs precisely — and fix
              them the first time.{" "}

              Replay MCP is purpose-built for debugging React-based web apps.
              If your team has meaningful surface area in React —
              a product, a platform, an internal tool — and you&apos;re using
              AI coding agents like Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, or Windsurf
              to build and fix it, this program is designed for you.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your stack is primarily mobile, backend, or outside the React
              ecosystem,{" "}
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium">
                Replay MCP probably isn&apos;t the right fit yet.
              </span>{" "}
              We&apos;d rather be honest about that upfront than waste your
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              What matters beyond the stack: you care about making the
              debugging loop faster, and you&apos;re willing to tell us
              honestly when something doesn&apos;t work the way it should.
