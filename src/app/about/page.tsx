          Replay started with a simple belief: if you can&apos;t see what your
          software is doing, you can&apos;t fix it. We built the technology to
          change that &mdash; for developers, for AI agents, and for anyone
          building with code.
        </p>
      </section>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-muted text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Debugging has always been the same: guess what went wrong, try a
              fix, see if it works. Repeat until you get lucky or give up and
              rewrite.
            </p>
            <p>
              We thought that was broken. Our founders spent a decade at Mozilla
              working on the Firefox browser engine &mdash; one of the most
              complex software systems ever built. They saw firsthand how much
              time gets lost to bugs that nobody can reproduce, errors that
              nobody can explain, and fixes that nobody is confident about.
            </p>
            <p>
              So they built Replay: a way to record exactly what your software
              did and play it back, step by step. Not a video. Not a log file.{" "}
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium">
                A deterministic capture of every DOM change, network request, and
                state update

              &mdash; the full picture, down to the last detail.
            </p>
            <p>
              That recording changes everything. When you can see what actually
              happened, debugging goes from guessing to knowing.

        <div className="space-y-6 text-muted text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Today, AI agents write code faster than any human. But when they hit
            a bug, they&apos;re stuck &mdash; guessing at fixes with no way to
            see what went wrong. They loop, retry, and burn through tokens on
            the same mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Replay gives agents eyes on the runtime. Our MCP server analyzes
            recordings automatically, finds the root cause, and delivers a
            specific fix &mdash; so your agent implements the right solution on
            the first try.
          </p>
          <p>
            For developers, that means fewer debugging hours and faster CI. For
            builders using tools like Lovable, Bolt, and Replit, it means bugs
            that actually get fixed instead of going in circles.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&apos;re building toward a world where every bug report includes a
            recording, every test failure comes with a root cause, and no one
            &mdash; human or AI &mdash;{" "}
